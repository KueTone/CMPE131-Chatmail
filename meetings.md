  - (Johnathon) worked on login, logout, profile, edit profile, and SQL database. Made a working page for all but edit profile, and created the basic structure for SQL database but did not integrate into. I plan to fully integrate and develope the SQL database, create a working edit profile page whos information will be displayed in the profile page, and create basic directions for users to use our webapp.
  - (Phillip) What I did: Created compose_email() function in routes.py, implemented flask mail API in init.py, added CreatingEmail.html, added ComposeEmail class to forms.py to include recipient's email, subject, and body to composing email. What I will do: I will add changes to compose_email() and CreatingEmail.html because they are not fully developed. I will also implement the function to allow user's to attach image files to their email composition and to create check lists on homepage.
  - (Dorian) What I did: created the createAcct method in routes.py and created the create account html page. What I will do: integrate the database functionality to make createAcct functional as well as creating the option to delete the account on the profile page.
